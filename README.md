# Plant Disease Classification

## About

Welcome to the Plant Disease Classification project! This repository is dedicated to developing a machine learning model that accurately identifies and classifies various plant diseases using image recognition techniques. With the increasing importance of agriculture and the need for sustainable farming practices, early detection of plant diseases is crucial for minimizing crop loss and ensuring food security.

### Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

- **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse dataset of plant images, including healthy plants and those affected by various diseases.
- **Model Development**: Utilize state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to train a model capable of classifying plant diseases with high accuracy.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability in real-world applications.
- **Deployment**: Create a user-friendly interface or application that allows farmers and agricultural professionals to easily upload images and receive instant feedback on plant health.

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Data Sources**: Publicly available datasets from agricultural research institutions and universities.

### How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! If you are interested in improving the model, adding new features, or enhancing the documentation, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
